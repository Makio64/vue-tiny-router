## Quick Start

Install vue-tiny-router:

```bash
npm install vue-tiny-router
```

Set up your router:

```javascript
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { TinyRouterInstall } from 'vue-tiny-router'
import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App)
  .use(TinyRouterInstall)
  .mount('#app')
```

Configure your routes:

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <TinyRouter :routes="routes" />
</template>

<script>
import { TinyRouter } from 'vue-tiny-router'
import Home from './views/Home.vue'
import About from './views/About.vue'

export default {
  components: { TinyRouter },
  data() {
    return {
      routes: [
        { path: '/', component: Home },
        { path: '/about', component: About }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Navigate programmatically:

```javascript
// In your components
this.$router.push('/about')
```

## Why Vue Tiny Router?

### Bundle Size Comparison

| Router | Bundle Size (Brotli) | Features |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| vue-tiny-router | **1.02kb** | Route params, guards, lazy loading, redirects, anchor links, memory mode |
| vue-router | ~34kb | Full-featured router with extensive API |

### Perfect For

- **Performance-critical applications** where every byte counts
- **Embedded Vue apps** within larger applications
- **Simple to medium complexity** routing needs
- **Projects** that need basic routing without the overhead

### Essential Features

- ✅ Route parameters (`/user/:id`)
- ✅ Route guards (`beforeRouteLeave`)
- ✅ Lazy loading with `defineAsyncComponent`
- ✅ Redirects and default routes
- ✅ Anchor link support with smooth scrolling
- ✅ Memory mode for embedded scenarios
- ✅ Programmatic navigation
- ✅ Auto link interception

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support ES6+ and the History API.

## Migration from vue-router

Most common patterns work the same way:

```javascript
// vue-router ✅ → vue-tiny-router ✅
$router.push('/path')     // Same API
$route.params.id          // $router.params.id
beforeRouteLeave(next)    // Same API
```
